/**
 * @file supabaseClient.ts
 * @description This file is intended for the initialization and configuration of the Supabase client.
 * Should Supabase be integrated into the application in the future, the necessary setup
 * (e.g., creating the Supabase client instance with URL and anon key) will be done here.
 * This provides a dedicated place for all Supabase-related setup, similar to how `firebaseClient.ts`
 * handles Firebase setup.
